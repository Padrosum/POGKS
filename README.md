## About

POGKS is the repository for the POGKS project. This README is a starter template — replace this section with a short project description that explains what POGKS does, its goals, and the problem it solves.

If POGKS is an acronym, expand it here and include any high-level architecture or important design decisions.

## Features

- Feature 1 — short description
- Feature 2 — short description
- Feature 3 — short description

Customize this list with the main features of the project.

## Prerequisites

List the tools or runtime versions required to work with the project. Examples you may want to edit:

- Git (>= 2.x)
- Node.js (>= 18) and npm/yarn, or
- Python (>= 3.8) and pip, or
- Rust and cargo, or
- Java and Maven/Gradle

Also mention any OS-specific notes or required environment variables.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Padrosum/POGKS.git
cd POGKS
```

Follow the appropriate commands for the project's language/runtime. Examples (edit to match this repository):

Node.js

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install
# run the app
npm start
```

Python

```bash
# create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS / Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pogks.main  # or whichever entrypoint applies
```

Rust

```bash
cargo build --release
cargo run --release
```

Add or remove these examples so they match how POGKS is built and executed.

## Usage

Provide examples and common use-cases here. Include command-line examples, screenshots, or configuration snippets as needed.

Example CLI usage:

```bash
# Example command
pogks --input data/input.json --output results/
```

Explain configuration options, environment variables, or file locations that users need to know about.

## Development

Include notes for contributors and maintainers about the development workflow:

- Branching model (e.g. `main` for stable releases, `develop` for ongoing work)
- How to build locally
- Code style and linters
- How to run the development server (if any)

Example:

```bash
# run dev server
npm run dev
# or in python
python -m pogks.dev
```

## Testing

Describe how to run tests and any testing frameworks used in the repository.

Examples:

```bash
# JavaScript / Node
npm test

# Python (pytest)
pytest

# Rust
cargo test
```

If the repo includes CI (GitHub Actions, etc.), link to the workflow files or describe how to run the same checks locally.

If you want, I can update this README with content tailored to the repository's primary language(s) and detected files (for example, add exact build and run commands after inspecting package.json, pyproject.toml, Cargo.toml, etc.). Would you like me to detect the repository structure and adapt the README accordingly?
